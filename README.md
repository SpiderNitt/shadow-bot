Summer Vacation Workplan for MATLAB suspension simulation:
1. We need to decide on which type of modelling approach we are going to use based on what we know about the model and how much detail we want from the simulated model
2. We want good plots that correspond to the environmental force (let's call it Fe) and the motion of the end of spring (x)
   so that the profile will give us the damping constant, spring constant and other stuff
3. We will need position, velocity plot along with the interaction/environmental/external force
