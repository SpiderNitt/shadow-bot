Simulating suspension systems is what we are starting with
Simulation with either equations or simulink anything is fine
We want good plots that correspond to the environmental force (let's call it Fe) and the motion of the end of spring (x)
So that profile will give us the damping const, spring const and stuff
We will need position, velocity plot along with the interaction/environmental/external force
