The Trajectory Generated by this is given to the controller as a the reference to be followed.

In this problem we try to generate trajectories based on cubic
splines.The cubic splines require a set of waypoints and a set of time
stamps during which they have to be traversed through.The waypoints are
generated from path planning algorithms and the time stamps are to
determined based on the physical limitations of acceleration and
velocities of our bot.This trajectory generation aims to generate a setof optimal time intervals which 
helps us to construct the required cubic
spline.Since the optimization problem here is highly convex and non
linear in case of cubic splines,we employ a method called particle swarm optimization to help us
achieve our objectivr.
