# Impedance Control

## Abstract:
The impedance of a mechanical system can be defined as the ratio of forces experienced to the velocity. Thus, impedance control is distinct from both position/velocity control and force control. Impedance control is implemented here to achieve the specified desired dynamics.
## Proposed controller
The designed controller is capable of imposing the desired behavior defined by impedance on the original complicated behavior of the end-effector.
