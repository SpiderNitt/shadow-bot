This paper presents the design and dynamical analysis of an All Terrain Robot (ATR) with a novel suspension and wall climbing mechanism. One of the main subsystems of an ATR is the suspension. Traditional suspensions involve spring and dampers with fixed properties which limit the usability of the vehicle. The proposed design uses a rigid front link whose dynamics can be altered according to the impact, thus providing stability in a wide range of environmental conditions. One of the main limitations of the existing all terrain bots is wall climbing. The front links in the proposed design uses a unique wall climbing mechanism to move from the ground to the walls autonomously, which most of the existing design do not address to.
