\section{Conclusion}
In summary, this report discusses about :
\begin{itemize}
    \item ATRs and wall climbing bots, the existing designs and limitations,
    \item How the proposed design overcomes the limitations presented by the existing bots, without compromising the performance,
    \item How adaptive suspension is superior to the current technologies for suspensions in ATRs or All Terrain Vehicles in general,
    \item How the integration of the suspension and wall climbing modules makes the bot traverse through any terrain with ease and
    \item How the cost of maintenance and repair in conventional ATRs can be reduced by introducing the proposed modules.
\end{itemize}
