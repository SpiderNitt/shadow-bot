\section{Wall Climbing }
The bot has a unique autonomous wall climbing mechanism which makes it robust to traverse any kind of rough terrain. The wall climbing mechanism is initiated by the response from the ultrasound sensors which detects the presence of obstacles.

The front links then move up and the bot move moves forward. Once the bot reaches the an optimal distance from the obstacle the EDF is turned on to give an upward push and the bot slides along the wall like a ladder. Once the bot is facing the wall the front links are bought down to the original position and the bot moves up on the obstacle due to the EDF Thrust and the rear-wheel drive Torque.
